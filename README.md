## Abstract

Climate change mitigation efforts underscore the pivotal role of Alternative Fuel Vehicles (AFVs) in reducing transportation emissions. This study investigates public perception of AFVs in South Korea using YouTube comment data from 2010 to 2024. By applying Keyword Co-occurrence Network and sentiment analysis, we examine public opinions and emotional responses over time. Results indicate predominantly negative sentiments towards AFVs, with major concerns centered on charging infrastructure and battery technology. A shift in public interest from hydrogen technology to battery and charging infrastructure is observed. The study identifies that complex and frequently changing subsidy policies decrease public understanding and engagement. We highlight the need for multifaceted policy approaches, technological advancements, and enhanced consumer education to address these challenges. This methodology offers a robust tool for exploring public perceptions, providing valuable insights for decision-making in transportation and energy policy, and contributing to climate change mitigation strategies.
