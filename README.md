## Abstract

Climate change mitigation efforts underscore the pivotal role of Alternative Fuel Vehicles (AFVs) in reducing transportation emissions. This study investigates public perception of AFVs in South Korea using YouTube comment data from 2010 to 2024. By applying Keyword Co-occurrence Network and sentiment analysis, we examine public opinions and emotional responses over time. Results indicate predominantly negative sentiments towards AFVs, with major concerns centered on charging infrastructure and battery technology. A shift in public interest from hydrogen technology to battery and charging infrastructure is observed. The study identifies that complex and frequently changing subsidy policies decrease public understanding and engagement. We highlight the need for multifaceted policy approaches, technological advancements, and enhanced consumer education to address these challenges. This methodology offers a robust tool for exploring public perceptions, providing valuable insights for decision-making in transportation and energy policy, and contributing to climate change mitigation strategies.

## Datasets

We collected YouTube comment data from January 2010 to February 27, 2024. YouTube, with its extensive user base and diverse content, is an ideal platform for analyzing public opinions and emotions. 

The data collection started in 2010, coinciding with the commercialization of Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs) in Korea. The YouTube Data API v3 was used to gather comments using keywords such as `electric vehicle`, `plug-in hybrid`, `hybrid`, `hydrogen vehicle`, and `eco-friendly vehicle`. These keywords were chosen to reflect key terms related to Alternative Fuel Vehicles (AFVs). In total, 1,176,360 entries were collected through the YouTube Data API v3.
